# nearest_neighbours_mixing

this is an **incomplete** Python implementation of the nearest-neighbours-based mixing matrix as descriped in Kollmorgen et al., 2020. 

For a complete implementation, please have a look at DataSpace: https://github.com/skollmor/dspace.

When using this implementation, or the complete one included in DataSpace, please **strongly** consider citing the following paper:
